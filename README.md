## Conclusion From Analysis
While analyzing and visualizing this dataset we were able to gain insight into the following questions:
* What is the average salary for a data scientist?
* What Are the Most Common Job Titles for Data Scientists?
* What are the best paying Job Posting Titles for Data scientists?
* What is the average salary for each experience level?
* What is the average salary for each expertise level?
* What is the average salary for each company size?

We found that the average salary for a data scientist in the past 4 years is $142,095.98, which has increased to $153,600.71 in the year 2023. The most common job titles for a data scientist are "Data Engineer", "Data Scientist","Data Analyst", and following close behind is "Machine Learning Engineer". The job title with the highest average salary is "Analytics Engineering Manager", followed by "Data Science Tech Lead" and "Data Engineer".

The average salary for each experience level is as follows:
* Entry Level : 79,921.00 USD
* Mid Level : 108,715.00 USD
* Senior Level : 160,277.00 USD
* Executive Level : 191,512.00 USD

We also observed that the average salary for both experience and expertise level are directly proportional to each other.

The average slary for each company size is as follows:
* Small : 87,387.68 USD
* Medium : 149134.10 USD
* Large : 117,681.40 USD

Some places that might cause bias in this dataset are:
* The dataset is from only a single job posting source
* Some job titles are very similar to each other and could be grouped together
* There are jobs that have only been listed once or a few time which could skew the data
